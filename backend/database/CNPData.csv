Arrupe Jesuit serves economically disadvantaged students from Denver’s inner-city neighborhoods. By enhancing the human, intellectual, and spiritual capacities of our students through a rigorous, innovative, and affordable college preparatory education, we offer hope for a brighter future to some of Denver’s neediest youth. Our goal is to empower graduates who will continue their education and return as leaders in their communities.
",2003,"Children and Youth, Low Income",,,,,"Jesuit education is rooted in the formation of the whole person. Arrupe Jesuit aims to prepare students for success in college and beyond through the following programs:
College Preparatory Curriculum – College Prep is the focus of Arrupe Jesuit’s academic studies, ensuring graduates have a mastery of core subjects that both prepares them for their continued studies in higher education as well as meets the requirements for acceptance into colleges and universities. Most students who come to Arrupe Jesuit have been educationally underserved and function one to three years below grade level. Most incoming freshman test at the 5th or 6th grade levels in mathematics and literacy. To help students reach their potential, Arrupe Jesuit adheres to a rigorous, student-centered academic framework. All students are required to take four years of English, math, science and theology; three and a half years of social studies; three years of Spanish; one semester of art; and one semester of computer literacy. 
Corporate Work Study Program (CWSP) – While attending a full schedule of classes, Arrupe Jesuit students work for their corporate employer five days per month; schedules are coordinated through sections so that students do not miss school to be at their job. Through their job, students earn approximately half of the annual cost of their education, giving them both ownership over and pride in their work and education. The staff at Arrupe Jesuit trains the students, transports them to and from their jobs, and handles employer services such as payroll, workers compensation, and insurance. At their jobs, students perform services such as reception duties, scanning, filing, data entry, and many special projects. This pivotal program offers a life-changing opportunity for students to experience a professional setting first-hand, expanding their imagination for their own future, as they develop their skills and knowledge base.
Academic Support and Tutoring – Arrupe Jesuit sets high expectations for its students and provides a high level of support. Arrupe Jesuit offers a Seventh Period study hall that is mandatory for students who have not completed their homework, and optional for students who want extra assistance or time for completing assignments. Students in 9th and 10th grades have the option to re-do any assignment for a higher grade, and all students must re-do all assignments that received an “F” grade. All freshmen meet with their academic advisor every two weeks to monitor their progress and address any issues. These policies motivate students to succeed, help them connect to positive adult role models/mentors, and create a supportive culture at Arrupe Jesuit where each student feels that they are valued. 
College Counseling – Arrupe Jesuit students graduate prepared to continue their education in college and beyond. Our college counseling team works closely with students and families throughout their four years to help select appropriate schools and understand financial aid opportunities. All Arrupe Jesuit seniors are required to apply to at least three colleges or universities and complete five scholarship applications. Beyond their work with students, the college counselors work with colleges and universities nationwide to learn of opportunities and programs for first generation college students. Over 90% of Arrupe Jesuit alumni are first in their families to be college bound, making College Counseling a critical component of our mission.
Faith Formation – Following the centuries-old Jesuit tradition, Arrupe Jesuit forms students to be men and women for others, instilling in them spiritual growth, confidence, intellectual competence, character, and a life-long commitment to selfless servant leadership. Arrupe Jesuit helps its students develop a faith that can inform their daily lives. Each day begins and ends with prayer, and each afternoon all students and teachers stop to pray the Jesuit Examen. A student chapel was added in 2015 which aids in delivering our Catholic mission. Regularly scheduled Masses are offered for individual class sections as a central component of the Theology curriculum and as a foundational element of students’ faith formation. The highlight of faith life for Arrupe Jesuit students is a four-day Kairos retreat at Sacred Heart Retreat House. The Theology Department continues to promote the intellectual, personal and spiritual development of students through a curriculum approved by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.

",1997,"Children and Youth, Families",,,,,"ABOUT BRENT’S PLACE
Brent's Place—the primary program of the Brent Eley Foundation (BEF) — is a long-term home away from home for families who have a loved one with cancer or other life-threatening illnesses while they receive treatment at local hospitals, providing a place of hope and healing. In addition to Safe-Clean housing, we provide a variety of uniquely tailored programs and support for the entire family designed to help in the healing process. 
Who We Serve
We serve families with a loved one (children and adults) receiving bone marrow transplants, long-term oncology treatments, experimental treatments, and a wide range of other long term-medical crises.  We work with physicians and hospital social workers to determine who needs our services. 
Our Approach
In providing a home away from home for our families we focus on four key areas:
•	Physical Well-Being – Brent’s Place is, above all, a Safe-Clean haven for families who are far from home seeking life-saving medical treatment. We are one of the only long-term housing options capable of supporting an entire family during the long treatment process. Because we believe that together is always better, Brent’s Place helps families stay together so that they may simply be together.
•	Financial Security – Families staying at Brent's Place receive unlimited support, but never a bill. This allows them to focus on recovery and their family’s well-being rather than the steep cost of relocation, housing, and food. Reducing expenses during treatment has long-term benefits and enables families to return home with a greater sense of financial security.
•	Psychological Well-Being – Patients and families fighting serious illness face significant emotional trauma. The programs at Brent’s Place are designed to help each resident cope with the stress and anxiety associated with their medical journey. This support allows residents to focus on self-care and healing and may even help serve as protection against future mental health crises.
•	Family Life – A medical crisis has the power to break families apart, but Brent’s Place is here to protect them. We recognize that the continuation of everyday routines and family traditions provide stability for parents and children when their lives have been uprooted. We believe that offering families a warm and welcoming home away from home, as well as opportunities to create happy memories, builds love, trust, and resiliency. This foundation strengthens families during treatment - and for a lifetime.

Service Dog Advanced Training: Experienced dog handlers (advanced trainers) take on the job of training dogs that have completed the 18-month puppy raising program. The advanced trainers are responsible for teaching advanced service dog skills and preparing the dogs to be paired with a Colorado partner. All partners are carefully screened to identify their needs, determine whether they would benefit from a service dog, and to select the dog that would be the best match.
Service Dog Partnership Training: People who have applied and been accepted as assistance dog candidates are individually matched with a dog and trained in one-on-one sessions with a qualified advanced trainer to become the dog's handler and life partner.
Community Education: Canine Partners of the Rockies (CaPR) visits service organizations, clubs, schools, churches and businesses to talk about assistance dogs, their work and the process of raising, training and placing dogs.

",2000,"Children and Youth, Latino/Hispanic, Low Income, Rural, Urban",,http://www.facebook.com/celebratethebeat,,http://www.instagram.com/ctbeat,"CTB inspires 3,500 children annually in 25 partner schools in 8 Colorado counties through in-school, after school and summer programming in dance and music.  We partner with Innovation Schools to offer entire grades dance classes led by teaching artists and accompanied by live music. Classroom teachers dance with students, strengthening the classroom as a whole, and an annual theme connects our classes with academics, deepening the students’ relationship to their classroom work.  
In-school programming is central to our mission. It allows us to be totally inclusive because we work with all students in their respective classrooms regardless of their initial skill or enthusiasm for dance. We believe that every child has a powerful beat within and it is our hope to teach them to find it, hear it, feel it, embrace it, express it and celebrate it. It is our privilege to inspire children to set ambitious goals and give them the tools to achieve more than they dreamed possible before dancing with CTB.  
Children who are ready for more challenging choreography are invited to participate in our after-school Dream Team (Dancers Reaching Excellence Artistry Mastery).  Building upon the success of our after school programs, three years ago we launched the Fresh Air Experience; a 3-day camping trip to Aspen for Commerce City dancers. For many it was their first time sleeping in a tent in Colorado's majestic mountains. This year we launched a high school mentoring program through which CTB alumni assist in our after-school programs for elementary and middle school students. 
CTB has collaborated with cellist Yo Yo Ma, Princeton professor Elaine Pagels, and ballet dancers Damian Woetzel, Heather Watts and Misty Copeland. Other partners include the Vail Dance Festival, Boys and Girls Club, Aspen Ideas Festival, Colorado Legacy Foundation and Healthy Schools Summit, Colorado Association of School Executives, and Crested Butte Music Festival. In 2013 and 2016 CTB students from Adams 14 performed for the Colorado Education Initiative Healthy Schools Summit for over 800 educators, including the Lieutenant Governor of Colorado.

In direct response to schools closing in late March 2020, CherryArts halted all in-person education outreach and immediately began creating individual Art Kits filled with art supplies for students to continue their creative learning at home. Each kit includes art supplies, creative lesson plans for two art projects printed in English/Spanish and linked tutorial videos with CherryArts at Home. 
As the health crisis continued, it became apparent that more and more students would be needing traditional school and art supplies, as well as access to food assistance. This was the impetus for building a partnership with Food For Thought Denver, an organization that strives to eliminate weekend hunger for children in the Denver Metro area. The majority of schools served through Food for Thought have a free and reduced lunch rate of 90% or more with a family earning only $29,000 in annual income. 
When Food for Thought’s distribution season came to an end, we continued to see a massive need across our community, so we reached out to Denver Public Schools and other cultural organizations across Denver to partner in continuing to provide Art Kits including: DPS Grab and Go food distribution sites, recreation centers through MY Denver, Warren Village, Boys and Girls Clubs, the Denver Indian Center and the Globeville Center. 
CherryArts has provided Art Kits to over 7,000 students!
As we continue to provide access to art and art experiences to students, we are actively working with Denver Public Schools to collaborate on a plan to continue serving students with Art Kits. 
According to the American Academy of Pediatrics and the National Art Educators Association, “Visual art, design, and media arts education enables learners to clarify and communicate perspectives, transform personal narratives, and imagine new possibilities,” all of which are so desperately needed for students experiencing extreme personal turbulence both at school and at home. Providing Art Kits and other accessible virtual art programs is necessary for the health and wellbeing of students and families experiences the impacts of COVID-19.

Thirty Student Docents per school are trained to provide gallery tours, creating ownership of the program and building their self-esteem, public speaking and critical thinking skills. Each venue hosts a Community Night for families and the local community to access the exhibition, furthering each gallery's impact.
• Serves K-12 aged students with curricular adaptations available for Elementary, Middle and High School, as well as, bilingual adaptations and sensory enhancements
• 300 schools have hosted the Mobile Art Gallery since 1998

Student Art Buying Program:
Since 2001, the Student Art Buying Program has gifted over $300,000 and over 900 pieces of art to Colorado schools. Students explore the world of art in a classroom module that culminates in a hands on art buying experience at the world renowned Cherry Creek Arts Festival. Through the program, students learn and practice valuable skills such as teamwork, negotiation, art appreciation, art-buying, public speaking, and more. Due to COVID-19, participating students and schools will engage with professional artists virtually through their art buying experience.
This unique opportunity features:
• Each participating school will receive an in-class Study Guide and lesson plan with curriculum and exercises to help students understand and appreciate art as more than a personal preference, but also as a reflection of culture and as a business. Teachers and students are encouraged to include the entire student body in exploring what kind of art would be appropriate and appreciated in their building.
• Schools are then invited to select three students to represent their student body.
• These young ARTrepreneurs will be given a budget to select and purchase art for permanent installation in their school. All participating schools will visit our exhibiting artist page here: https://cherrycreekartsfestival.org/exhibiting-artists/ and select their top three artist choices.
• Students will then engage with their chosen artists through virtual studio tours allowing them the first hand experience of exploring the entire art making process from start to finish!

Our aim is fulfilled through (1) the development and support of the infant and early childhood workforce, and (2) our expertise on Colorado public policy matters that impact young children.
",2000,All Populations,,,,,"The Endorsement for Culturally Sensitive, Relationship-Focused Practice Promoting Infant Mental Health (IMH-E ®) is not a license or certification, but rather an overlay onto a person’s professional credentials that recognizes achievement of knowledge and training in the area of infant and early childhood mental health. The Endorsement is one of the first and most comprehensive efforts in the country to identify best practice competencies at multiple levels and across disciplines and to offer a pathway for professional development in the infant, early childhood and family field.
Colorado Foundations is CoAIMH’s 8-Module foundational training for infant and early childhood professionals. The course is unique in its ability to promote a shared understanding and common language of infant and early childhood mental health principles to all professionals who touch the lives of infants and toddlers and their families. In doing so, Colorado’s early childhood community will be equipped and locally partnered to provide a continuum of high-quality, consistent infant and early childhood mental health supports to children and families.
(PLEASE NOTE that Colorado Foundations is not intended to replace advanced clinical knowledge and training that would prepare a professional to provide evidenced-based clinical treatment.)
The intended audience of the course is Early Intervention providers and service coordinators, early care and education providers, home visitors, public health nurses, and other early childhood providers. Further, the curriculum content supports the Competencies associated with the Infant Mental Health Endorsement for Culturally Sensitive, Relationship-Focused Practice Promoting Infant Mental Health (IMH-E®), which facilitates the growth of necessary knowledge for those professionals seeking the IMH-E®.
The course is designed to be delivered locally and in person. Colorado Foundations can be delivered in a format that best meet the needs of the community, e.g., a 8-week/month learning collaborative that allows for a deep dive into each Module at each session, a 3-day intensive training that covers 2-3 modules each day, etc. The complete training offers approximately 18-20 contact hours of continuing education, depending on the chosen training format.
CoAIMH Reflective Support Resources
IMPORTANT: Beginning January 1, 2018, all new Endorsement applicants are required to receive all RS/C hours from an Endorsed provider in order to meet the requirements for Endorsement. Additional details, frequently asked questions, and other supporting documents can be found below. Please direct all questions to Jean Cimino, CoAIMH’s Endorsement Coordinator.
RS/C Requirements for the Infant Mental Health Endorsement. This provides more details about the change in RS/C requirements beginning 1/1/2018.
Best Practice Guidelines for Reflective Supervision/Consultation (RS/C). This gives an overview of RS/C in the context of Infant Mental Health; describes the knowledge, skills, and practices that are critical to reflective supervision/consultation; and distinguishes between administrative supervision, clinical  supervision/consultation and reflective supervision/consultation.
Developing Reflective Practice Supervision/Consultation Skills. This document details the different models for developing reflective practice supervision/consultation skills.
Questions About Applicants’ Reflective Supervision Experience. These questions are useful as you consider how to describe your reflective supervision in your application for Infant Mental Health Endorsement®.
In response to the increasing interest in the Infant Mental Health Endorsement® and the new 1/1/18 requirement that all new Endorsement applicants are required to receive their RS/C hours from an Endorsed provider in order to meet the requirements for Endorsement, CoAIMH is providing this directory of infant mental health professionals who can offer RS/C services. Please see the CoAIMH Endorsement materials for details about the requirements at each category of Endorsement as you are deciding the necessary level of competence for your particular training or RS/C needs.
CoAIMH provides the Resource Directory as a service to its membership. These individuals do not provide services on behalf of CoAIMH as employees, agents, or any other representative of CoAIMH. Any action, advice, or services provided by such individuals are not endorsed or facilitated by CoAIMH. CoAIMH does not receive payment or participate in the arrangements or contract negotiations, and these individuals do not represent CoAIMH in any way.
All arrangements between those included in the Directory and those seeking their services will be made without further CoAIMH involvement. That is, the scheduling of any training, consultation or supervision commitments as well as any fees or other agreements will be made directly between the trainer/consultant and individual/program seeking the service. If you are interested in inquiring about one or more of the training, consultation or supervision services listed in this Directory, please contact the individual directly to discuss specifics.

Denver Homeless Out Loud works to advocate for the rights, needs, and housing of those without. We amplify the voice of people without housing by conducting and publicizing surveys and interviews with the homeless community, by organizing homeless people to speak up in the community and political arenas, and by maintaining a core group of people in the organization with direct homeless experience. We work to decriminalize homelessness by publicizing the effects of laws that criminalize homelessness, advocating to political officials for the change of these harmful laws, and fighting these laws in the courts. We work to advocate for sanitation resources to be available for people living without housing both by advocating to the City for the ongoing and sustainable implementation of resources including bathrooms and water. We work to advocate for the creation of housing that is attainable to low and no-income people through research and reports, educational presentations, political pressure, and direct action. Advocating for the rights and needs of the homeless community in these ways helps us amplify the voice of the homeless community, decriminalizing homelessness, and fighting for a day when housing is accessible for all.
SURVIVAL RESOURCES
Denver Homeless Out Loud also is committed to supporting the immediate survival needs of those without housing. We provide some sanitation resources to those living outside including port-a-potties, hand washing stations, and trash collection. Providing these resources directly not only meets the immediate need but also furthers to advocate for the City to provide these needed resources. We also provides tents, tarps, and sleeping bags when possible to those in need. Providing these resources directly helps us engage the homeless community in our work, showing the community what is possible, and supporting the very survival of those we advocate for.

Mentoring, at its core, guarantees young people that there is someone who cares about them, assures them that they are not alone in dealing with day-to-day challenges, and makes them feel like they matter. Research confirms that quality mentoring relationships have powerful positive effects on young people in a variety of personal, academic, and professional situations. Ultimately, mentoring connects a young person to personal growth and development and social and economic opportunity. Students who meet regularly with their mentors are 52% less likely than their peers to skip a day of school and 37% less likely to skip a class. (Public/Private Ventures study of Big Brothers Big Sisters) Young adults who face an opportunity gap but have a mentor are 55% more likely to be enrolled in college than those who did not have a mentor.

",1946,All Populations,,,,,"Four challenges will continue to drive the direction of a significant portion of the Foundation’s grant making, the manner in which the Foundation invests and deploys its capital, and the role the Foundation’s staff play as partners, conveners, and leaders:
1) The challenge of educating all of our children – Low-income children and children of color are not achieving at rates remotely comparable to their more affluent peers.  A growing population of children faces limited prospects and dramatically reduced opportunities to participate in the economic and social life Colorado communities, let alone function as global citizens.  Closing this achievement gap while raising the achievement bar for all children remains a core priority for the Foundation.
2) The challenge of providing responsible stewardship of the state’s natural resources – Colorado’s natural resources face challenges due to climate change, significant declines in forest health, increased potential for catastrophic wildfires, and significant impacts due to energy development and growth of the recreational economy.  Population growth increases pressure on natural systems and drives the conversion of land and water to urban use.
3) The challenge of accommodating more people – Colorado’s population is anticipated to double within the next 40 years.  The kinds of communities we create to accommodate the needs of this much larger population will have profound implications for a variety of aspects of life in urban and rural communities throughout the state.
4) The uncertain future of rural communities – Rural communities and rural culture are an essential part of the identity and character of Colorado.  But the future facing rural communities is full of challenges.  Many face unprecedented growth pressures, while others are struggling to survive.

The vision of Griffith Centers for Children is to be the premier resource for nurturing and developing children and families to become healthy and productive members of society.
Guiding Principles:
Commitment  ⦁  Responsibility  ⦁  Respect for Self and Others
Health in Mind, Body and Spirit  ⦁  Continuous Learning  ⦁  Collaborative Attitude
Financial Self-Sustainability ⦁ Controlled, Sustainable Growth
Griffith Centers for Children is a private, non-profit organization providing therapeutic and academic programs for children and their families. Founded in 1927 by Emily Griffith, a well-known Colorado Educator. Griffith Centers for Children treats troubled teems by using a unique approach of experiential methods. The design of the program interfaces the clinical therapeutic living and residential school components with the non-traditional, high-impact learning opportunities through wilderness experience.
At Griffith Centers for Children, it is our belief that children can and should be responsible for their own behavior. Therefore, we encourage independent decision making, in an environment which is structured and supportive. We believe we can effect behavioral change and accelerate emotional, social and academic growth through the therapeutic climate of this non-traditional center.
The center is at full capacity year-round. Because the majority of the clients are publicly funded Colorado children (and this underfunded by the state), it is necessary for Griffith Centers for Children to raise additional funds during the year to support the Centers’ operations.
The unique experiential component of Griffith Centers for Children treatment process is a year-round intensive and concentrated approach designed to maximize treatment efficacy and academic achievement. This program integrates all aspects of the clinical, therapeutic living and residential school programs into a comprehensive effort designed to accelerate a child’s growth.
We believe the programs of Griffith Centers for Children to be unique alternatives to traditional care and institutional settings.

Community Programs:
Community Based Programs provide services to families throughout Colorado. Our teams are dedicated to supporting family stability, reunification, and overall mental health and wellness. These services include trauma informed outpatient counseling for children, adolescents and adults, family preservation, supervised and therapeutic visitation and behavioral coaching (mentoring). Services are provided in home, in office or the community.
Population Served by Community Programs
Male and female youth and adults, who have active/eligible insurance or private pay options, and/or are in the custody of county-based Department of Human Services are eligible for Griffith Centers for Children services. Youth with mental health concerns, substance abuse, learning disabilities, special education needs and clients with offense-specific issues are provided services through the continuum of care, not provided at other treatment centers. Youth needing assistance to successfully reintegrate back into the community, whether that is with family or moving into an independent living status, are also provided needed services.
Family Preservation:
To help prevent family disruption, or to prepare for reunification, family preservation workers may provide in-home intensive therapeutic services that are flexible and individualized to each family. These services may involve intervention with the individual, the entire family or appropriate community members. In-home services for sexual offenders include risk assessment, safety planning and informed supervisor training. As a client prepares to transition back into the community, from residential services, the team offers the opportunity to put family preservation in the home to help with the transition for this high-level of care to the community.
Foster Care Services:
Foster care programming includes immediate placement into safe homes for at-risk children, aged 0 – 18. Traditional or Therapeutic Foster Homes/Parents are available for immediate response to crises and the team provides reunification or adoption planning and the facilitation of services. The team also provides supervised visitation with biological parents, if deemed appropriate by the treatment team or by court order.
Outpatient Individual and Family Therapy Services
Outpatient therapeutic services offer the following components: 24/7 crisis intervention and flexible scheduling, including evenings and weekends. A strong emphasis is places on each client’s criminogenic risk factors, with youth and family. Risk assessments, safety planning, strengths-based and skill-building services are offered. This is to assist with accessing community services, advocacy with the system and follow-up services for one year following termination of outpatient programs.
Individual and or family therapy services are provided as recommended. Outpatient therapy services are available for all clients, regardless of level of care or out-of-home placement. Therapists are able to address various mental health needs through the use of evidence-based, clinical approaches. Therapy services are highly recommended for clients placed in our foster homes and residential treatment facilities, and as a client transitions from our residential programming back into the community setting. The clients may be able to keep their same therapist, through the continuum of care not seen in other programs.
Life Skills Parenting:
Life skills and parenting services are provided through coaching and modeling to help the parent adequately gain the necessary skills to continue successfully on their own. The worker may also assist parents/guardians/caregivers in overcoming barriers to getting more involved in the youth’s treatment, such as communication, transportation, time management and skills of advocating for the youth.
Mentor/Behavioral Coach Services:
Mentoring or behavioral coaching helps the youth needing assistance to successfully reintegrate back into the community, whether this is with the family or moving to an independent living status. This service encompasses a variety of mentoring and skills-building activities in a strengths-based approach. Intensive one-on-one mentoring is provided by experiences, therapeutic mentors to help facilitate building relationships, increasing pro-social skills and learning from a role model.

Day Treatment Program (Education Services):
Most young people who have experienced trauma have unique challenges in their educational goals. Challenges can range from loss of credits due to school moves, challenging school environments, a lack of commitment to education, and various other challenges that are a priority at that time. The Day Treatment Program is an alternative to Residential Treatment and is suited for individuals who are able to function with lower amounts of structure when school is dismissed.
Day Treatment services provide special education classrooms for students referred by school districts or who are placed in our Residential Programs. Kaufman testing shows 1.5 – 2.6 years of grade-level advancement for each client placed in Day Treatment Programming, for each of the last 4 years. The education team provides a responsive student to staff ration of 3.5 clients to 1 staff member. Individualized Title 1 programming improves reading skills for students who have fallen behind on reading and comprehension.

Children are encouraged to respond to different elements of the music, from thinking about how it makes them feel to getting on their feet and moving. They are treated to up-close-and-personal demos by various instruments, introduced to musical concepts, emotional understanding of the arts, and artistic expression. The music selection, design, and scripting of Tiny Tots is geared to connect very young children with music – physically, emotionally, and mentally. Children are also encouraged to take a closer look at the instruments and ask questions of the musicians after the program has concluded. Every Tiny Tots event includes guest performers from our cultural partner organizations. This year, to enhance the experience for attendees, we have added a pre-program packet. This e-packet is designed to help enhance a child’s experience with the music. It lists the Tiny Tots repertoire, says what activities will take place at the program, and gives suggestions for activities people can do at home or at school for each piece as well.

Honor Awards – Every year since 2008, we have had the opportunity to honor organizations, businesses and individuals who are making a positive difference in the lives of people living daily with invisible disabilities. Some of the awards are given to individuals who persevere year after year through illness and pain. Others inspire us in the midst of their struggles and triumphs by sharing their invisible disability journey to lift up and encourage. Some are invisible heroes who focus their energy and lives on the support of veterans and first responders which are recognized through our Invisible Heroes® Campaign.
Invisible Disabilities® Week – The third week in October is a time to share your journey with invisible disabilities. In 2015, three US Governors joined together in proclaiming invisible disabilities week. Each day during IDW offers an opportunity to share your invisible disability story, tell a friend, wear blue or an Invisible No More® wristband and let people know who and what you are thankful for.  All of the IDW events are online and available around the world.
Education
Brain IDEAS Symposium – In 2015, we launched our Brain IDEAS (Invisible Disabilities® Education and Support) Symposiums. The Brain IDEAS Symposiums focus on Brain Disorders, Brain Health, and Brain Therapy. Nine expert speakers delivered dynamic, science, and story-filled talks on relevant topics such as Neuroplasticity, Mental Health, ADHD, ADD, Autism, Learning Disabilities, Dyslexia, Alzheimer’s, Down Syndrome, Nutrition, Microbiome, Mental Training, Therapeutic Humor, Stroke, PTSD, EMDR and TBI. Expert-led panels for questions and answers conclude each section allowing attendees to interact with the presenters.   Make sure to check out the videos of each session and panel as they become available online.
But You LOOK Good – Do your loved ones have a hard time understanding your chronic illness or pain, because to them you LOOK fine? But You LOOK Good is a book that gives those living with chronic illness and pain a voice about how they feel, what they need and how others can be an encouragement to them. It is a convenient, informative way to educate loved ones about what people living with ongoing illness and pain struggle with, fight for and need from their friends and family. BYLG is easy to read and provides practical ideas on how loved ones can be supportive.
Cleaner Indoor Air Campaign – Millions of Americans report allergic, immunologic, asthmatic and neurological reactions to perfumes, colognes, chemicals and synthetic fragrances. For these groups of people, just leaving their homes can mean risking the possibility of an exposure to chemicals in the environment. The CIA Campaign is an educational resource for everyone interested in learning how to lessen the chemicals in their own daily lives as well as to help public establishments become less threatening environments for people who experience mild to severe reactions to chemicals and synthetic fragrances.
Connection
Invisible Disabilities® Association Community (IDAC) – We have hosted online communities since 1999. In 2015, we were selected as a Trusted Partner and launched the IDAC on the Inspire platform. With the IDAC now on Inspire, our members have access to over 200 support communities, more than 100 Trusted Partners like IDA and over 750,000 members! The IDAC connects patients, families, friends and caregivers for support and inspiration.

Social Media – We have numerous pages across the social media spectrum. We encourage you to join in the conversations, share your invisible disability story with others, create new friendships, provide connection to your support groups and inform each other about upcoming awareness events.

",1981,All Populations,https://twitter.com/mercyhousing,https://www.facebook.com/mercyhousing,https://www.linkedin.com/company/mercy-housing,https://www.instagram.com/mercyhousing/,"Stable, healthy housing is often the start of a journey to an improved life for Mercy Housing residents. Mercy Housing began providing services to residents shortly after the organization was founded, and it has been at the core of our work ever since. The Resident Services Program is currently offered at 70% of our properties with a focus on education, health and wellness, financial stability, housing stability, and community engagement. Services are conveniently offered at the property and free-of-charge; typically in the form of classes, one-on-one coaching, or referrals to partners in the community. The overall goals of the program are to help residents become financially stable, maintain stable housing, perform better in school, value their health, and actively participate in the community.  
The Resident Services Program Model is based upon best and evidenced-based practices designed to generate desired outcomes.  The five priority programs are outlined below:
Housing stability services ensure that residents have access to the knowledge, skills and resources they need to sustain their housing. This is done through eviction prevention coaching, lease education, and connections to financial assistance. Participants in housing stability services maintain continuous, safe and stable housing and are renters in good standing.
Health service coordination involves identifying health-related service needs, developing strategies to link residents to needed health and wellness resources, and brokering health and wellness services from other organizations on behalf of Mercy Housing residents. Examples include health screenings conducted by health professionals, food banks, health education, physical activities for adults, and assistance accessing wellness entitlements. The health service coordination priority program benefits residents by encouraging access to health benefits, regular care, and food resources, resulting in healthier behaviors and improved overall health.  
Financial stability activities focus on developing effective money management and decreasing vulnerability to financial crisis. These educational resources are offered in one-day or multi-week installments. The program encourages residents to open a bank account, create a budget, know their credit score, and improve their career skills.  
Out-of-school-time programming regularly engages youth in educational activities, leadership development, community services, physical activity and recreation. Out-of-school time programming occurs at any time all year round. The program helps youth to have confidence in their school performance, develop leadership skills, gain self-confidence, and increase their involvement in the community.    
Community participation programming encourages a safer, more cohesive community by organizing resources, such as community projects, environmental stewardship activities, leadership development or safety initiatives. Participants in the program will be more likely to volunteer and participate in property-based events, community problem-solving and other neighborhood activities.

Our programs feature live conversations with authors, comics writers, artists, and other creators, interactive how-tos and tutorials, online gaming streams and other virtual presentations, and much, much more. Our goal is to create virtual experiences that support and highlight our diverse community of educators, creators, families, and students by providing educational experiences they would normally experience through our on-site and in-school workshops.
These opportunities - along with our weekly PopStream video livestream and podcast - provide a virtual community hub for friendly, educational, and meaningful conversations about the pop culture that brings us together.
Educational Resources - Through our Educational Resources Program, we develop and publish free monthly standards-aligned teaching guides, educational comics, and curricula on our website.
As educators who have spent time in a variety of classrooms and learning environments, we know the struggles that many teachers and parent-educators face in their efforts to engage students - especially with the recent shift to distance and virtual learning. That's why we create new resources each month to help show students, parents, administrators, and educators unlock the transformative power of pop culture media at home or in the classroom. These resources include:
-Monthly educational comics that tackle important topics, themes, and events throughout Colorado and U.S. history.
-Teaching guides designed to help educators bring new and established graphic novels into classrooms as powerful teaching tools.
-Curricula developed in accordance with national standards that teach students vital learning skills.
-Blog posts and other informal resources to help parents and educators navigate distance learning.
Workshops - These services include field trips, workshops and camps -- focusing on topics like cosplay, sewing, game design, photoshop, podcasting, stop-motion animation, coding, and comics -- and much more. We believe that underserved students greatly benefit from these quality arts and literacy education, and we have continued providing these opportunities in virtual formats for free or at steeply discounted prices to schools and community centers to support youth during the crisis.
In 2020 alone, PCC has worked with partners like Sun Valley Youth Center, Florence Crittenton High School (which provides comprehensive services to teen mothers and their families), Heart and Hand Center (a local nonprofit providing one-on-one mentoring focused on college and career exploration and planning), and other community partners seeking to support underserved youth and under-resourced sites throughout Denver and Colorado.

- Training and supervision of volunteers for service with people on the margins of our society
- Volunteer opportunities that emphasize relationship and skills development, such as mentoring and soul care
The following programs express our mission:
1. Making Choices – Since 1999, Making Choices has brought together more than 750 incarcerated women with volunteer teachers and mentors. Once released, graduates participate in advocacy efforts through our Women's Voices speaker's bureau, and help to train new volunteers.
2. Soul Care at Denver Women's Correctional Facility - What is the responsibility of the soul care provider for those living on the margins? Service of sisters and brothers on the margins is essential for spiritual growth; this is reflected in every religious tradition. 
3. Healing Art is a therapeutic program available at Denver Women’s Correctional Facility that uses the creative process of making art to improve a person’s physical, mental, and emotional well-being. This program is currently on hold because the prison has been closed due to the coronavirus pandemic.
4. The Restoring Connections Re-entry program - designed to help connect recently released women with the support they need, and allow them to take charge of their future. Getting released from prision during the coronavirus pandemic is an extremely disorienting experience. Support women who are currently in re-entry by becoming a soul care provider and mentor. Mentors are a source of emotional and spiritual support for women in re-entry, which reduces recidivism and enables spiritual growth for everyone. Our committed and passionate volunteers are from a variety of careers and professions with training in decision-making, job search and interviewing, communication, financial management, conflict resolution, parenting, and accessing local resources. 
5. Soul Car for Everyone - This is a confusing and disorienting time. This time away from others also provides us with more opportunity to pay attention to our inner life and to grow spiritually. Restoring Connections has a number of well-trained Soul Care Providers who are willing to be available to you online or by phone.
6. Formation Program for Soul Care Directors -
Our ecumenical formation program deepens individuals' abilities to serve as Soul Care Providers and retreat leaders. Faithful to our Vincentian Ethos, we provide a special emphasis on being present to people who are economically poor, homeless, or in otherwise marginalized circumstances. Our program enriches both individuals seeking initial training in spiritual direction as well as experienced spiritual directors. Now in its 32nd year, our formation program draws an international participation.
7. Soul Healing (Advanced Certificate in Trauma Spiritual Care) - Soul Healing responds to the needs of spiritual directors, ministers, chaplains, pastoral care workers and social service workers to more effectively address the soul care issues that emerge following natural disasters, tragedy, or violence in the community. Our commitment to those who live in poverty and on the margins has enabled us to develop an expertise in the spiritual aspects of a healing response to trauma.
8. Elder Wisdom - provides programming on the spirituality of aging and the importance of serving as an elder in the community.
9. Capitol Hill Day -
Our advocacy efforts empower the people we serve to reclaim their voices as we work together to change unjust systems. Every year, Restoring Connections advocates alongside previously justice-involved women and their families at the Capitol. This allows us to support the voices of the women we serve and make meaningful impact in local policy.
10. Letter-Writing Campaigns - Connecting with legislators is a key way to push for social and political process. We hope to end the negative consequences brought about by our current system, and provide as many opportunities to marginalized communities as possible through letter writing campiagns to our local representatives.

Our work involves both direct service and systems change but in each of our endeavors, legal and clinical services are woven together, focusing on ensuring that trauma-affected children and youth have safe, permanent homes; appropriate education; and the resources to address unmet emotional and physical needs. Our mission, to advocate for children and youth, drive systemic reform, and boldly challenge the status quo so that every young person who has experienced trauma or instability has the opportunity to thrive, is fulfilled through several focus areas intersecting our two major approaches to improving the lives of children: 
1. Direct  Service - Legal Advocacy and Trauma-Informed Services: RMCLC provides legal representation related to crisis response; caregiver advocacy for kinship and non-kinship caregivers in gaining legal rights to care for children in their charge; legal representation for children involved in domestic violence civil protective order cases brought before Denver County Court; education advocacy for students needing access to appropriate education services; and civil legal services for older youth experiencing homelessness and who cannot transition to adulthood because of a lack of enduring relationships, diminished opportunities for life skills training and education, and legal obstacles often traced back to simply being homeless. RMCLC also provides differentiated services responsive to social determinants of health such as Safe Babies Court Team model (SBCT) and trainings for child-serving professionals. 
2. Policy Advocacy and Catalytic System Reform: RMCLC uses its vast experience in child welfare to galvanize social change through public awareness, legislative and policy engagement, strategic partnerships, and innovative approaches. This includes empowerment of current and former foster youth, hosting the Colorado Children’s Legislative Caucus at the State Capitol and leading system reform efforts such as Catalyze for Kids, a RMCLC initiated cross-sector collaboration currently focused on ending homelessness for youth exiting foster care.
Our work is informed by our belief that:
- Every child deserves a safe and stable home with caregivers who meet their needs.
- Supportive relationships with caring adults are essential to the well-being of youth.
- Every young person who has experienced trauma should have access to the opportunities and supports they need to heal, imagine, and reach their highest potential.
- When systems aren't working for children and families, we should fight for change.
- Amplifying the voices of young people is critical to what we do.
- Our power to advocate for children and families and improve systems stems from our community - our staff, our clients, our partners, and our funders.  We are stronger together.

Mission:  Invest in Student Success
Vision:  The Five Star Education Foundation contributes to the improvement of the overall quality of life in our community through investments in educational services and programs to assist Adams12 students in achieving their full potential.
",1985,"All Populations, Children and Youth, Low Income",,https://www.facebook.com/5StarColorado/,,,"Student Success Incubator Funds:  The Five Star Foundation believes that teachers and students know the pathway to future success.  They just need support and resources.  Student Success Incubator Funds INVEST in these results driven projects designed by students and teachers and walk the path them to TEST, PROVE and SCALE these opportunities.  Last year this program funded $60,000 in unique projects proposed by students and staff.
Youth Advisory Board:  Our board knows that student voices need to be heard at all levels to successfully support their educational needs.  The Youth Advisory Board, while in the initial stages, is bringing students to the table to identify problems in the schools, set direction for solving those issues, make funding decisions, and be part of the strategic planning process with the foundation board.  This program gives real world leadership and decision making experience to a diverse group of students.  The goal is to grow this to student representation from all high schools by the end of the year.
Career Discovery:  Studies show that exposure to career options early in the educational process help them more readily achieve career success.  Working with our business and government partners, we provide programing to immerse students in all aspects of a career field.  They can then take this knowledge and choose educational pathways to their future career.  We are piloting this program with one business partner and are looking to duplicate it in 3 more fields this year targeting low income students.
Career Readiness: For students to be ready for the workforce, they need skills, training on relevant equipment and certifications necessary to succeed in today's job market.  We help students identify WHAT they want to be, what EDUCATION they need to do that and then WHERE they need to go to get that education.  We walk this with them every step of the way.  The program supports the P-TECH (Pathways Early College High School), B-TECH (Business Technology Early College High School) and CTE (Career and Technical Education) programs in the district with equipment, partnerships, and certification funding.  This program is growing to include mentorships, internships and apprenticeships that give ALL students a level playing field.  We are currently serving almost 500 students in these areas and are looking to double this number.
Capacity Building:  There are so many passionate volunteers in the community that are doing amazing things for their local schools and our students. Together with the district, the foundation discovered that there was no central resource nor leader for parent volunteers, teachers and community members to get information and support for their projects.  We fill that need through grant writing workshops, assistance on local school fundraisers and professional support to make sure we are all doing what's best for our student's success.  We currently facilitate $200,000 in funding for individual programs through capacity building.
Learning Readiness:  Extensive studies show that setting students up on the path to success begins with being ready to learn.  This is ensuring students are warm, safe and dry.  It means meeting social/emotional benchmarks to be academically successful.  A portion of our work focuses on making sure the students we serve are READY for the programs we offer.  Some examples of our work are a laundry facility at an alternative high school, social-emotional curriculum for K-5 students at an impacted school and technology to engage students with significant disabilities in a traditional classroom.

This includes individual, family, group, equine, canine, EMDR, DBT, Trauma-focused, and substance abuse therapies, along with mindfulness techniques.
Connecting youth with an advisor who acts as a mentor, tutor or connection to necessary resources assists in growing confidence while building a pathway toward future endeavors, goals, and positive outcomes.  Focusing on youths’ educational needs in order to streamline their current goals in school with their future goals as they mature.  We focus on college preparation, job-shadowing and life skills education. 
Tutoring efforts meet our youth where they are currently at with their educational needs. We act as a liaison between the youth and the school, connecting and collaborating with school professionals who can positively impact the youth's needs during school hours. This allows us to bridge the gap between what is happening at school and how we can effectively work with them outside of the school setting.
Engagement in the community helps broaden a youth’s prospective on life, and more specifically their life. Linking youth to pro social activities creates a hands-on learning environment that promotes advancement, inquisition, desire, and hope.  Within these concepts, youth are also developing life skills and preparation for their future.

Description of programs:
BEHAVIOR/MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES (ANIMAL ASSISTED THERAPY UPON REQUEST)
Soul Dogs, Inc. provides individuals on the DD/ID Waiver with behavior therapy and mental health  services to include assessment, consultation, counseling and behavior line staff services. We specialize in treating those who have experienced trauma and who are ready to utilize an emotional support or service animal; this plan is to be added to his/her/their service plan. Many of the services are community based meaning we meeting the individual where he/she/they lives, works or plays to enable and teach the person how to handle stressors of everyday life and live a more, independent and inclusive life with the help of the service animal and support persons. We also have an on site office if the individual we serve prefers to meet in this setting.
All behavior services are funded through the Colorado DD Waiver Services. All therapists are trained in animal-assisted therapy and utilize their dogs who are trained by Soul Dogs, Inc. All therapists receive training in trauma-informed care as well as grief and loss, cognitive behavioral therapy, mental health issues, attachment disorder, etc. Behavior therapy/mental health therapy is typically one hour/week; behavior line services support the behavior plan by providing additional support up to six hours/week at home or in the community.
SPECIALIZED DAY HABILITATION #1: DOG TRAINING
An onsite program three days/week is provided on site so trainers/participants 	may teach the dogs the necessary skills in the specialized day habilitation program. Our goal is for each participant to attain his/her/their maximum functional level or to be supported in a way allowing him/her/them to gain an increased level of self-sufficiency. We believe dogs are a vital piece for these individuals to feel safer and less alone so they may better access the community. 
Services will include assistance with self-care, sensory stimulation and reduction of alarm to sensory stimulation, as well as reinforce skills taught in this program. The dogs will be taught the skills needed to mitigate the symptomology associated with PTSD. For example the dog can interrupt panic attacks, remind the individual to take medication, create a barrier in public if the person feels crowded, and aid in hyper-vigilance by clearing dark rooms and turning on lights, and reducing social anxiety by having a partner in the community that they trust. Participants may choose to become involved in the train-the-trainer program where they will learn to train dogs; at the end of the program they may teach classes to community members under the guidance of Soul Dogs, Inc.’s trainers/staff.
Skills necessary, such as dog training, dog grooming and feeding, veterinary care, CPR/First Aid, etc. will be taught in the on-site specialized day habilitation program to participants in a way they may integrate so they understand the necessity of caring for their animal partner; additionally specialized classes will be taught by local professionals. Our program will only serve up to six individuals and six dogs per session. Our specialized day habilitation program is located  next to a park, a training area, across the street from a strip mall with numerous stores, restaurants, health club, etc. where we may train off-site.
SPECIALIZED DAY HABILITATION #2: SOCIAL PROGRAM
	Saturdays from 3-9pm we offer a social program where individuals may come to work on social skills, relationship skills, and socialization skills. Ongoing activities will be offered to stimulate conversation and engagement. This is part of our day program. Once/month our Saturday will take place off-site in a local venue. ON HOLD DUE TO COVID19.
 SPECIALIZED DAY HABILITATION #3: FAMILY LIFE CENTER
Soul Dogs, Inc. is developing and hopes to implement within the next month a parenting program for parents with intellectual disabilities. The coronavirus has impacted an already ostracized and isolated population. Research (Heifetz, Brown, Chacra et al., 2019; Meppelder, Hodes, Kef & Schuengel, 2015) supports the thesis that parents, especially single mothers with intellectual disabilities are more likely to reduce self-care and care of their children when highly stressed, alone, and confused. We propose a multi-tier program to address the needs of families: 
1) Develop a parent center located at Soul Dogs, Inc. 5005 W 81st Place, Westminster CO 80031 that will provide ongoing support, socialization opportunities, play time for the children while parents are “taking a break” with other adults, and classes in parenting, stress reduction, mindfulness and meditation, social skills and support in accessing services in the Denver area.
2) Provide individual, family, couples and group therapy for parents, to include group therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, trauma recovery therapy, relationship skill building, problem solving, compromising skills.
3) Provide individual and group therapy for the children including play therapy and classes to better deal with the stressors and confusion of living with I/DD parents.
4) Provide a single moms support group that would include meeting on a weekly basis. It would address challenges of being a single mom and allow single mothers to connect and form a support network. The group members can assist with parenting stress, ways to balance family responsibility, allow the women to talk openly and honestly about their feelings, focus on improving skills to cope with challenges. Formal supports are essential are essential to supporting their mental health as parents (Heifetz, Brown, Chacra et al., 2019; Meppelder, Hodes, Kef & Schuengel, 2015). This group is open, meaning anyone can join at any time. This group will also focus on the challenges of mom’s living with I/DD.
5) Provide ongoing art classes for parents and their children. Children benefit from social-emotional learning that helps them manage their emotions. Art allows children to interact with the world around them, and helps them to create a new avenue for self-expression, and communication. Art is supportive in children’s development (Bentensky, 1973). Art activities include: sculpting, watercolor painting, paint by numbers, playdough modeling, shaving cream marbling and crafts. Not only does art allow for self-expression for children, it also allows the parent to have time to themselves (unless they provide assistance to the child). In order to avoid parenting burn-out, especially during the time of the covid-19 pandemic, the art classes for children will allow parents to “take a break”, and return with a fresh mind, which will hopefully make parenting easier (Kautz, C., Parr, J. and Petrenko, C., 2020).
6) Provide home based support whereby support workers (Behavior Line Staff) visit and support the parents in practicing the skills they learned in classes and are listed on their Behavior Plans, offer a friendly ear, provide “grownup time” for the parent and offer any support needed in caring for their children, and assist them as they combat the loneliness and isolation of being a parent.  This is a vital part of our services and will be provided once we are given the go-ahead to gather in small groups, we will ensure group size meets the requirements of our Governor, the CDC and other public health advisors.
Soul Dogs, Inc. will provide the following to participants in the program to better facilitate engagement and connection:
Bus passes if needed
Night out programs for parents to get together (when feasible) to socialize while Soul Dogs, Inc. provides child care
Art supplies to the families for the art program
*Community members are invited to attend all programs on a donation basis.
SUPPORTED COMMUNITY CONNECTIONS
Supported community connections will be a part of the daily program each day, taking the dog-participant teams into the community to practice skills learned in the onsite program as indicated above. SCC supports the abilities and skills necessary to enable the participant to access typical activities and functions of community life with the support of their animal partner. These activities occur in the community where our participants interact with non-disabled individuals and learn how to ask for help and navigate daily activities of the “typical” population, such as grocery stores, big box stores, restaurants, banks, parks, etc. These activities encourage socialization with the general community and learning how to answer questions about their dogs and the purpose for the dog. It will also enable us, as support persons, to understand what the training needs are to better support the individual. Places may include, but are not limited to: libraries, grocery stores, big box stores, 16th Street Mall, restaurants, public transportation, museums, the airport, local small concerts, street fairs, dog parks, parks, classrooms at the local community college, etc. The goal is to teach skills in the community, retain and improve on skills learned in day habilitation, feel safer and more comfortable in the community, and be a better dog caretaker.
NON-MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION
Soul Dogs, Inc. provides transportation to and from residences to day program and from day program to work as needed 	for those on the HCBS-DD and HCBS-SLS waivers. The service is provided to enable participants to gain access to waiver and other community services, activities and resources as specified by the Service Plan.

Our services and programs meet basic needs, foster personal growth, and build community.  Instead of client, TGP uses the term member to refer to the people who seek out and benefit from our services and programs.  All TGP services and programs are provided free of charge and utilize trauma-informed care practices.
Building community is woven through our work, on a number of fronts with a large number of stakeholders.  It involves: providing regular and periodic trauma-informed care trainings for staff, Board, volunteers, and members to ensure greater understanding of our commonalities, TGP’s philosophy, and our approach to creating a safe community; opening channels of communication with members via community meetings twice a week; involving members in writing and ensuring access to our internal, bi-weekly newsletter, TGP Post; equal and active participation in the Member Engagement Steering Committee, which is charged by the TGP Board of Directors with developing a variety of ways to partner with members in governance, decision-making, and daily activities – this committee consists of members who receive services, board members, staff members, and volunteers working in partnership; welcoming community volunteers, which has a two-fold impact of connecting more people to our community and leveraging their time as a resource to decrease personnel expense; and engaging members as long-term volunteers and promoting their direct involvement in providing services, such as clothing distribution.
Members are also currently volunteering in the computer lab, serving on Advocacy Committee and Member Engagement Steering Committee, and keeping the “success” bulletin board designed and updated.
Within this framework, our work flows into three primary areas.
1.	Meet Basic Needs:  Resource advocates on the Community Access Team (CAT) respond to members’ immediate needs with services that include showers, laundry, naps, mail service, locker storage, telephone access, and an extensive array of resources and referrals.  Similar to the CAT response, TGP’s Family Program provides support to families in a safe, nurturing, and developmentally rich environment and the team is available to care for children while mothers/guardians utilize or participate in other TGP services and programs.
In our community dining room, the Food Services Program serves freshly prepared meals (breakfast, lunch, and supper) that include healthy and delicious options, which accommodate most dietary needs and preferences.  For example, vegetarian options are available for meals.  Our Food Pantries (Betsy’s Cupboard and Family Program) provide healthy groceries, baby food/formula, toiletries, and diapers.  
Bridget’s Boutique, TGP’s clothing bank, distributes clothing to members who have an emergency need for replacement clothes or need clothes for employment reasons. 
2.	Foster Personal Growth:  TGP’s Education and Job Readiness Program helps members reach their goals, advance their education, improve their employment potential, and increase their income.  Educational opportunities for adult members at TGP include the High School Equivalency Program, Skills Development Classes, Writers Group, and Book Club.  The High School Equivalency Program is provided in collaboration with Community College of Denver and provides students who test at a seventh grade reading level or above with classroom instruction in a dedicated study room, pays testing fees, and provides access to computers for studying and taking tests.  Students who have a reading level below seventh grade can increase their reading level and math skills through the Skills Development Classes, which are led by volunteers, and include instruction in English as a second language. Additionally, all members are welcome to participate in the drop-in Writers Group and Book Club, which also bolster literacy and learning.  
Job readiness opportunities include job search assistance, onsite job fairs, and private appointments.   Job search assistance sessions, held twice per week, include dedicated time in the computer lab to complete online job applications, help from volunteers on resume and cover letter building, and assistance with conducting online job searches.  At least once a month, a job fair is hosted onsite and can either be a practice event with human resource volunteers or an actual hiring fair with an employer.  Private appointments with the Job Readiness Program Manager also provide members a chance to discuss their job or education related needs and get referrals, assistance, and advice.  
TGP’s computer lab provides access to technological opportunities and offers freedom of choice in a modern lab.  Volunteers run the lab and are available to help members learn computer software and programs.  Because many businesses, educational institutions, and service providers are increasingly dependent on computer and web-based services, the importance of “computer literacy” cannot be overestimated.
The Physical and Mental Health Program promotes wellness and growth by increasing access to health care information, services, and referrals.  Bringing partner agencies and pro bono health professionals onsite to serve members relieves various barriers to care (e.g., transportation) for members who are already at TGP for other reasons.  Additionally, by building trusting and collaborative relationships with both members and partner agencies, TGP is able to provide ""warm hand-off"" referrals where members are introduced personally to outside partner agencies, improving the success rate of such referrals. The program also provides assistance to pay for prescriptions or pharmacy gift cards for minor medical supplies and over the counter medications.
The Arts Program is a broad category of creative programming that includes, greeting card art, knitting and crocheting, open art, a creative writing group, and a music group.  Some of these endeavors have intangible benefits such as increased self-esteem, the opportunity to be part of a caring community, and the chance to engage in creative expression.
3.	Social Enterprise: Art Restart:  Art Restart was launched in 2014 as a social enterprise to diversify and expand TGP’s funding sources and give members an opportunity to earn supplemental income from their artistic talents through sales marketed through the Unites States.  Art Restart provides members with the support and supplies they need to create their own art.  Select pieces are then turned into custom merchandise from which the artists receive a royalty on every purchase made.  Art Restart was recently chosen as a social venture finalist out of 150 applicants in a competitive process with over 138 judges from around the Unites States.

We offer food distribution programming and educational opportunities related to growing and cooking food, as well as overall wellness. We strive to be a community-driven organization, meaning that our goal is to have all programs led and implemented by members of our community or others from similar neighborhoods. We are successful when the youth, families, and communities we work with are empowered to feed, nourish and strengthen themselves and each other.
Food Distribution: The GrowHaus’ food distribution programs offer healthy and affordable food options for residents of Globeville and Elyria-Swansea (GES) and Greater Denver. We offer no-cost and low-cost food boxes to residents of GES, which include fresh food as well as food staples. When residents purchase a food box they are also able to add on featured products from our online market. 
Youth Education: The GrowHaus offers youth education that focuses on growing and cooking healthy food and wellness, while providing opportunities for personal and leadership development. During the school year, our education team partners with schools and other community partners to offer after-school programs working to instill healthy eating and wellness habits at a young age through experiential classes. In the summer months, we host an eight week teen leadership program, Seed2Seed, where high school students learn how to be advocates for themselves and their community while developing healthy habits.  We also run “Bees”, a multi-generational set of classes held each summer for young children and their parents or guardians. 
Community Outreach: The GrowHaus' community outreach programming engages with members of our community and connect them with resources so that they can cultivate healthy and nourished families and communities. All of our adult education programs are led by our Promotora team who are from or representative of the Elyria-Swansea and Globeville communities. Promotoras lead classes about growing food, cooking food, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Promotoras also conduct one-on-one home visits for more personal interactions and to connect residents with other community resources.

Summer Camp - Established in 1957, Thorne Summer Camp in Boulder and Littleton reaches 2,300 youth each summer through field-based “Camp Experiences” for kids ages 3-15. Learning takes place through hands-on, science-based, experiential activities. Popular camps like, Mud Mucking, At Home in the Woods, and Bird Banding utilize local prairie grasslands, evergreen forests, and wetland habitats as a classroom and enable youth to connect with and learn about nature. To ensure that no child is ever turned away from participating due to financial need, Thorne awards more than $110,000 (20% of sales) in scholarships annually.
Field Trip Program - Created in 1999 through a Partnership with the City of Boulder Open Space and Mountain Parks Department and the Boulder Valley School District (BVSD), the Field Trip Program engages 1,800 BVSD fourth graders annually in a day-long field trip to the 45-acre Sombrero Marsh Environmental Education Center. At the Marsh, students learn about wetland ecology while hiking on boardwalks, viewing birds from a bird blind, and undertaking experiments in a laboratory. The Marsh is also home to a 30 ft. wind turbine, organic gardens, and a photovoltaic solar system which are used as educational tools to demonstrate the concept of conserving natural resources as a means of protecting the environment. In addition to serving 4th grade BVSD students at Sombrero Marsh, Thorne also offers Field Trips to other BVSD grade levels and non BVSD schools and youth-serving organizations at both its Boulder and Littleton locations.
In-School Program – Initiated in 2005, Thorne’s In-School Program reaches 7,000 elementary students each year. The In-School Program expands students’ knowledge in the areas of science and literacy through a three class series of lessons that involve interactive explorations, inquiry-based experiments, scientific instruments and specimens, and writing a picture book. Emphasis is placed on working with schools neighboring Thorne’s environmental education centers and low-income, low-scoring, and culturally diverse schools throughout the Denver and Boulder Metro Area. At select schools with very high percentages of disadvantaged youth, Thorne offers an additional twelve week After School Program for students who are interested in expanding their knowledge of science and connection to nature.

Our vision is a Colorado foodshed that is more mindful, humane, self-sustaining and connected, where everyone has access to protective foods and where markets value farmers for what they are: a cornerstone of our society. 
*Volunteer Gleaning Corps 
Our Volunteer Gleaning Corps harvests surplus fruits and vegetables from local farms—as well as fruit from the trees of backyard and urban gardens—for distribution to food pantries and meal sites on the Northern Front Range and along the Western Slope. Our gleaning corps is composed of individuals, families and corporate groups, staff from like-minded nonprofit organizations, partners who practice experiential-based learning, community-garden groups, and service-based organizations. We partner with existing hunger-relief organizations to efficiently distribute gleaned food to community members in need. 
*Mobile Farm Workforce (MFW) Pilot 2018-2019 | Farm & Food Workforce (FFW) Pilot 2020-Present
The MFW pilot was a collaborative effort between Rocky Mountain Farmers Union (RMFU), the Good Food Collective (GFC), Veterans to Farmers and UpRoot. Now entering its third year of operations, the pilot has provided smallholder and family farmers and ranchers in Colorado with on-demand and efficient labor. 
The pilot project has traveled to farms and ranches across Boulder, Delta, Denver, Jefferson, La Plata, Larimer, Montezuma and Weld counties during harvest season to support farmers and ranchers with harvesting and agriculture-related duties, reducing potential surplus crops and providing economic value to farmers and ranchers. 
The vision for this pilot in 2020 is to leverage furloughed or laid-off workers from Colorado’s restaurant industry to expand the reach of the pilot—now called the Farm & Food Workforce (FFW). We are also in discussions with the Colorado Department of Corrections (CDOC) to include incarcerated individuals in an agricultural workforce and development program in Delta County. 
Our goal is to continue to holistically fill labor gaps (potentially exacerbated by the pandemic), reduce on-farm surplus, prove concept and pave the way for a statewide, worker-owned professional agricultural services cooperative providing Colorado’s agricultural sector with labor in addition to a full complement of agricultural services including (but not limited to) skilled and unskilled (i.e., apprenticeships), farm planning, food-safety training and planning, marketing and graphic design, bookkeeping and accounting, grant writing, sheep shearing, consultation in soil health and transitions to regenerative-agricultural practices, and mental-health services. 
* Safe and Abundant Nutrition Alliance (SANA) 
UpRoot is playing a seminal role in the development of a regional food-systems coalition along the Western Slope—SANA—that will coordinate food access and equity efforts in Eagle, Garfield and Pitkin counties. SANA is composed of government and nonprofit entities working to build a strong, regional food system that supports local farm viability and ensures food access and equity for members of our communities. 
*Home Food Garden Project 
UpRoot is fiscally sponsoring the Roaring Fork Food Alliance’s Home Food Garden Project. The Home Food Garden Project was formed to increase the supply of locally produced food, today and moving forward, by supporting the creation of successful and productive home gardens, pairing Master Gardeners from Colorado State University (CSU), and other resources, with people throughout the Roaring Fork Valley. The Home Food Garden Project is managed by the Roaring Fork Food Alliance, an organization working from Parachute to Aspen to create a thriving local food system. 
*Farm-to-Food Pantry Partnerships 
UpRoot has provided consulting and technical-assistance services to food banks and pantries along the Western Slope who have received state funding to purchase produce, meat, and dairy from local farms. UpRoot has guided both farmers and food pantries through the process to foster connections, increase economic opportunity, and help farmers sell more of what they grow. 
*Legislative Advocacy 
UpRoot is collaborating with Colorado-based nonprofit organizations to research new legislation that will support Colorado family farms and ranches and create a more connected and healthy food system. These actions are in response to the “sunsetting” of the Colorado Charitable Crop Donation Act (CCCDA) on 12.31.19. 
*Research
UpRoot received a grant from World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to continue its research of on-farm surplus agriculture in Colorado. The second stage of our research into on-farm surplus in Colorado is now complete and includes both qualitative and quantitative data. Our research team consisted of PhD candidates Anna Hermes and Nathan Lee-Ammons at the University of Colorado, supervised by John Brett, PhD. 
*Statewide Gleaning Network 
We are involved in discussions with several communities along the Western Slope to pour the footings for a statewide gleaning network that empowers community members to take greater ownership of their local foodsheds, taking a page from network-models in both Maine and Vermont.

",1972,All Populations,,,,,"Technology
WESTAF is an experienced technology developer, with six distinct projects that benefit the arts and creative industries. WESTAF’s technology products are not discounted for participating states. However, states in the the WESTAF region can benefit from these projects by: a) arranging for cost-advantageous bundling of two or more technology products; b) negotiating free or discounted pilot programs for organizations within the WESTAF region; and c) receiving no-cost, on-site demonstrations of one or more of these programs in state conferences, arts agency governing board meetings, and other forums where such in-person demonstrations would be beneficial.
Convenings
WESTAF regularly convenes experts and leaders from fields both inside and outside the arts to address critical issues affecting arts and culture. These annual forums provide an opportunity to reflect on cultural policy issues particular to the West, to introduce practitioners in the region to one another, and to expand the acquaintance of national and international discussions of cultural policy with thinkers in the West. WESTAF’s 15th cultural policy symposium, Creativity and Innovation in Public Education: Areas of Need, Mechanisms for Change, brought together scholars and practitioners for a lively discussion on the research and policy work needed to advance creativity and innovation in public education. Discussions included the neuroscience of creativity; evaluation of creativity-based curriculum; innovative approaches to advance arts, science, and technology education; design thinking in higher education; and creativity as collaborative practice.
Grants
WESTAF currently administers two grant programs: Independent Music on Tour (IMTour™), a grant program for tour-ready independent musicians, and TourWest, a competitive grant program that provides subsidies to arts and community organizations for the presentation of out-of-state touring performers and literary artists.

",2008,"Elderly, Low Income, Veterans",https://twitter.com/wishofalifetime,https://www.facebook.com/wishofalifetime,https://www.linkedin.com/company/wishofalifetime/,https://www.instagram.com/wishofalifetime/,"It is through the granting of wishes that WOL helps to combat isolation and build a culture where seniors are valued, respected, and integrated into their communities. Wish of a Lifetime has four Wish Categories: Fulfilling Lifelong Dreams, Reconnecting Loved Ones, Renewing and Celebrating Passions, and Commemorating Service. The unique history of each wish allows WOL to build awareness of the sacrifices and accomplishments of our oldest generations, inspiring others to see seniors differently in their everyday lives.  The experiences also provide the opportunity to hear unlikely stories from Colorado seniors like the 101-year-old Ruth from Ft. Collins and her love of fishing, or 78-year-old Holocaust survivor Marlene of Denver.
The organization's internal criteria includes an assessment of whether a senior exhibits signs of social, mental, or physical isolation as a result of aging, which  provides Wish of a Lifetime staff the ability to evaluate the impact  of a Wish in reducing symptoms of isolation. Wish of a Lifetime also takes into consideration the challenges and obstacles that the senior has faced throughout the course of his or her life, how the individual has given back to others and their community, and the ability of the wish to inspire others to shift their perceptions of aging.  
WOL employs 28-30 volunteer interns from the Denver Metro area a year who fulfill 33% of the wishes. Not only do volunteer interns provide a valuable and efficient service to WOL, the organization is also fostering intergenerational connections and exposing younger adults to the wisdom of seniors and the challenges they face. Very few students are interested in working with older adults and as the senior population continues to boom, it is clear that society's engagement with older adults needs to grow as well. The volunteer intern program expands the number of wishes WOL can grant while maintaining a high quality of service delivery, and promoting intergenerational connections that are critical to fulfilling the mission and vision of the organization.
